# Railcraft

**Railcraft** is a lightweight Minecraft mod for Fabric 1.21.4 that adds a few new rail types with unique properties. Built using modern development tools like Data Generation and Mixin for maintainability and performance.

Note: You must slow down when making turns, if you're going too fast you will derail.

## Rails

- **Wooden Rails** – basic, low-cost rails with slower speed.
- **Lubricated Rails** – smoother and slightly faster than standard rails.
- **Ice Rails / Powered Ice Rails** – fast and slippery rails, great for speed-focused builds. (express lines!)

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).
2. Download the mod JAR and place it in your `.minecraft/mods` folder.
3. Launch the game with the Fabric profile.
